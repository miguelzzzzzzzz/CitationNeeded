# production-rag-engine

[![CI](https://github.com/miguelzzzzzzzz/production-rag-engine/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/miguelzzzzzzzz/production-rag-engine/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A retrieval-augmented generation engine built the way a production team would
build one: typed, swappable pipeline stages; structure-aware chunking with
exact source offsets; hybrid dense + BM25 retrieval with reranking; cited,
schema-validated answers; and a reproducible evaluation harness so every
design choice is backed by measured retrieval quality and latency.

> **Status:** early development (milestone M1 of 7, see [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)).
> Ingestion and chunking are being built first. No benchmark results exist
> yet; none will be shown here until produced by a committed evaluation run.

## Why this is not "chat with a PDF"

| Typical demo | This project |
| --- | --- |
| One loader, fixed-size chunks | Markdown/HTML/text/PDF loaders, three chunking strategies, heading-path and page metadata |
| Top-k cosine only | Dense + BM25 hybrid with rank fusion, metadata filters, cross-encoder reranking |
| Free-text answer | Pydantic-validated response with citations to exact character spans |
| "It looks right" | Recall@K, MRR, Hit Rate, nDCG and per-stage latency on SciFact (BEIR) |
| Requires a paid API | Runs fully on CPU with local ONNX models; LLM is optional behind a provider interface |

## Architecture

See [PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md) for the full design and
[docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for the decisions behind it.

```
files -> loaders -> Document(sections, metadata) -> chunkers -> embedder -> vector index + BM25
query -> dense + BM25 -> fusion -> reranker -> answer generator (LLM | extractive) -> cited JSON
```

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy && pytest
```

Configuration is read from `RAG_*` environment variables; see
[.env.example](.env.example).
